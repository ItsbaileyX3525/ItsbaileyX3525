# Hi there, I'm Bailey!
I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions using Python and occasionally C++. While I've received some help from friends along the way, I'm proud to say that most of what I know I've taught myself.

I've recently built my own website, which you can check out at https://baileyswebsite.ddns.net. It showcases my skills and accomplishments in more detail than I could fit here.

While I used JavaScript and HTML to build my site, I have yet to master languages like PHP and SQL. However, when it comes to Python, I'm a real expert. I'm currently in year 10 (or grade 10, depending on where you're from), and I'm proud to say that I'm at the top of my class. I even beat my teacher in practical skills!

In addition to Python, I occasionally dabble in other languages like C++. That said, these days, I primarily use Unreal's Blueprint, which I find much easier to use than coding from scratch.

If you're curious about my work, be sure to check out my GitHub account. There, you'll find several repositories containing games I've made and am currently working on.

Thanks for taking the time to read my README. I can't wait to see what exciting projects the future holds!
