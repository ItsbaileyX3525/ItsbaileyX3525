# Hi, I'm Bailey!

I enjoy coding, playing games and various other things! I code in many languages but the one I use the most is python and JS.

## Languages I know
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,c,cs,js,html,css,lua,rust)](https://skillicons.dev)

While I am more profcient in python and JS, I still can code at near the same level as all the other languages listed above (perhaps not rust as of now because I haven't had too much experience), most of the times I use python for creating short prototypes or quick applications and javascript for websites... Obviously. The main language I use now is gdscript which is used for godot and is it like python and C#.

# Studios I use
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=androidstudio,vscode,godot)](https://skillicons.dev)

I haven't used android studio in a long time but the other two studios I use almost every day from creating games with godot to writing simple python files in vscode. I enjoy godot for its simple use and its very easy learning curve that is has and I love vscode because it is very customisable even if it is just a glorifed text editor. I have dabbled in other studios but these are the main 3 that I use.

# Misc
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=discordjs,flask,git,github,gradle,raspberrypi,windows)](https://skillicons.dev)

DiscordJS is fairly new and I wouldn't say that I'm a master at it at all but I have created a simple bot that me and my friends use on discord! Flask, I have a lot of experience in, creating my own chatroom site so people can talk to each other and upload images all hosted from my very on flask server that anyone can connect to and even see on my repos (key is hidden). Git and github are self explanotory, gradle because of android studio and I use my raspberry pi for hosting my chatroom (When i use to host it) and finally windows, that is my main operating system, allowing me to code and play games!

# Thanks for reading!

Thank you if you read all this as this took some time to write out and have yourself a great day!
